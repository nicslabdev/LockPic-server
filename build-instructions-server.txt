This document describes how to compile the code for the companion
server for the Android application LockPic, available at https://github.
com/nicslabdev/LockPic, designed to be hosted by Google App Engine. We
assume Eclipse is installed, and also the Google App Engine SDK, available
at https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads.
This server is currently hosted and running at
https://scrambler-keyserver.appspot.com/keyserver.

We start by noting that the Android application contacts only with a
server in an established location. Compiling this code will generate a local
instance of the server, with a blank database, which will not interact with
the device.

To compile the project, it is necessary to indicate that we want to use
the Google App Engine functionality.

The project must be imported into Eclipse in the generic mode: File > Import, 
and choosing, under General, Existing Projects into Workspace

Once the project appears in the Project Explorer (left hand side bar),
right click on the project, and go to Google > App Engine Settings.

Select Use Google App Engine, and choose the desired version of the SDK.

With this, the project can be compiled and locally hosted with the Run
button in Eclipse. Deploying it to Google App Engine requires an account
with administrator permissions on the server.
