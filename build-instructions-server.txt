This document describes how to compile the code for the companion
server for the Android application LockPic, available at https://github.
com/nicslabdev/LockPic, designed to be hosted by Google App Engine. We
assume Eclipse is installed, and also the Google App Engine SDK, available
at https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads.
This server is currently hosted and running at
https://scrambler-keyserver.appspot.com/keyserver.

We start by noting that the Android application contacts only with a
server in an established location. Compiling this code will generate a local
instance of the server, with a blank database, which will not interact with
the device.

To compile the project from the code, it is necessary to indicate that we want to use
the Google App Engine functionality.

The project must be imported into Eclipse in the generic mode: File > Import, 
and choosing, under General, Existing Projects into Workspace

Once the project appears in the Project Explorer (left hand side bar),
right click on the project, and go to Google > App Engine Settings.

Select Use Google App Engine, and choose the desired version of the SDK.

With this, the project can be compiled and locally hosted with the Run
button in Eclipse. Deploying it to Google App Engine requires an account
with administrator permissions on the server.

To compile and upload a copy of the server from a WAR file, the program 
appcfg provided with the Google App Engine SDK 
(<GAE_SDK_path>/appengine-java-sdk-<version>/bin) can be used.

A Google account is required to upload it. Prior to deploying the server,
the application must be registered in the profile of the uploader, in his/her
Google Developer account. An identifier must be assigned to it at this point.

This identifier must also be input in the /war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml file,
between the <application> tags.

Once that line has been changed, it suffices to run appcfg update <war directory path>,
authenticate with Google, and the code will be deployed.
